# NeighborhoodMap Project by Rasha Ali

This is the final assignment project for Udacity's NanoDegree course.
It's a single page application written in reactjs.
This app uses Google maps APIs, and Foursquare APIs to fetch data about defined places on google map.

## How to run the project

To get started:

* Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* To run service worker:
  -  `npm run build`
  -  `npm install -g serve`
  -  `serve -s build`
The server in this case will start under port 5000
* Or start the development server with `npm start` (No service worker)
* Navigate to the main page and try its functions
